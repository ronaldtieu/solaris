# Solaris

**Strong Light, Controlled Fights**

This is the bare bones starting point for the Solaris website. Currently a skeleton, so will need the actual content and features added later.

## What is currently in this so far:

The homepage has a working navigation bar with a dropdown menu under Apparel, a carousel that cycles through slides automatically, and a product grid section. There's also a footer with links and a newsletter signup form. The styling is done and it's all responsive so it works on phones and tablets.

## Tech stack:

I kept it simple and didn't use any frameworks. It's just HTML for the structure, CSS for all the styling (no Tailwind or Bootstrap), and vanilla JavaScript for the carousel and mobile menu. The only external things are Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for the Orbitron and Inter typefaces.

## Start Up Instructions:

just ```npm start``` to start!
